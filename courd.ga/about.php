My name is Courd, I am 27 years old and from Queen Creek Arizona. I am a web developer looking to get started
 with making my passion for web development my career. Web development however, is not the only think I am
 passionate about. Just about everything computer related gets me excited.
 <br><p class="indent">
 I love to play video games, (add me on
 League of Legends or Vainglory @coolcourd) I run Ubuntu Linux on my personal computer exclusively,
 (dont worry, LOL runs fine with wine, but Riot, native Linux client please!) and I love to figure out how to make
 the computer do pretty much anything cool. Some of my favorite softwares include Blender3d,(Best application ever made!) Gimp, After Effects, Premiere,
 Inkscape, Unity3d and more.

I married this beautiful girl on Sep 7th 2013 and I am so glad that i have her. She is strong everywhere i am weak
and she always love me and wants me to be close by. She is supportive and has a heart of gold. Elizabeth is more
of a homebody and likes to stay in, but she is usually willing to go out with me when i want to run and play.
<br>
<p class="indent">
Even though i am mostly on the nerdy side, I am full of energy and always down to play. I get competitive
and like to play sports casually. I don\’t care to watch sports however, that\’s just boring. My favorite sports have
got to be volleyball, pingpong, skateboarding, and Tanourd ball. (it\'s a game I made up that is kindof like horseshoes)
</p>

<p class="indent">
Overall I am an excited, easy going guy who is always happy and willing to help. I am a man of faith in Jesus
Christ and I hope to reflect my view on who he is in how I behave.

I currently work at Endurance International Group as <a href="http://www.mojomarketplace.com/item/wordpress-support" target="_blank"> WP-Live</a> support for <a href="https://www.mojomarketplace.com" target="_blank">mojomarketplace.com.</a>
  I love being able to help people build and design their wordpress websites. Everyday I get the opportunity to speak with small business owners, entrepreneurs, bloggers and artists from all sorts of technical skill levels. I Love it when
  people tell me that I was able to help them fix an issue in minutes that they were working on for weeks.
  <br></p><p class="indent">
  As much as I love my current role, I am excited for the vast opportunities available to me at Endurance. Most of my free time is spent learning to code for web. My biggest focus has been on learning React javascript since there are opportunities
  available at Endurance for React developers. I am amazed at the speed and power of React and client side routing and I am excited to become an expert of that framework.
  <br></p><p class="indent">
  I am not currently looking to find much, if any, freelance work as a developer since I am focusing on mastering React,
 but feel free to <a href="./contact.php">contact me</a> if you have a good opportunity for me and I will be happy to talk with you. (Note that i will not accept any side work that violates EIG company policy in any way, including any requests from any wp-live customer.)

  <br></p><p class="indent">
  This entire website will soon be replaced with the version that I am making in React, but i will leave a link to this this php version.
